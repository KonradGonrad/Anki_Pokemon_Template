# Anki_Pokemon_Template
Hello,
Today I was watching some Youtube videos about Anki templates, because I was bored by classic Anki template. And when I was watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDpCiKCu20) I wanted to 
recreate this, and that's how I came up with this template.

Front:
<img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee62ae35-66f1-4951-82b7-5723a6cf590f" />

Back:
<img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8bbf7b5-5306-476a-b67f-907cb7bbe4d5" />

Pokemon images that I used in template were downloaded from this [site](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads)


# How to do this:
1. Create Basic Card
2. Add fields: Questions, Code, Answer 1, Answer 2, Answer 3, Answer 4, Correct Answer
3. In front template paste [code]()
4. In back template paste [code]()
5. In styling paste [code]()
6. To make sure that everything works, you need to paste also [media]() files into 'colection.media' folder in Anki. On Mac, you can search that by Go/Go to folder/~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/
