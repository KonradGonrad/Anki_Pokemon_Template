# Anki_Pokemon_Template
Hello,
Today I was watching some Youtube videos about Anki templates, because I was bored by classic Anki template. And when I was watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDpCiKCu20) I wanted to 
recreate this, and that's how I came up with this template.

Front: </br>
<img width="572" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/809617ad-50e6-4242-b442-216f058542d1" />


Back: </br>
<img width="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d25ac670-2c7a-4383-a174-ec03919a6302" />


Pokemon images that I used in template were downloaded from this [site](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads)


# How to do this:
1. Create Basic Card
2. Add fields: Questions, Code, Answer 1, Answer 2, Answer 3, Answer 4, Correct Answer
3. In front template paste [code]()
4. In back template paste [code]()
5. In styling paste [code]()
6. To make sure that everything works, you need to paste also [media]() files into 'colection.media' folder in Anki. On Mac, you can search that by Go/Go to folder/~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/
